In newer versions of Citrix Receiver for Linux (version 13??) you need to do some manual configuration after you install:

1. install full plugin
2. firefox Add-ons -> Plugins and set Citrix Receiver to "Always Activate"
3. firefox Preferences -> Advanced -> Certificates -> View Certificates 
4. export VeriSignClass3PublicPrimaryCertificationAuthority-G5 to a file
5. copy VeriSignClass3PublicPrimaryCertificationAuthority-G5 to /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/
