In newer versions of Citrix Receiver for Linux (version 13??) you need to do some manual configuration after you install:

1. install full plugin 
	dpkg -i warns on some deps.  Run apt-get -f install
	dnf install works 
2. Configure plugin to run in firefox:
	 Add-ons -> Plugins 
	Set Citrix Receiver to "Always Activate"
3. Get copy of Verisign cert from firefox:
	 Preferences -> Advanced -> Certificates -> View Certificates 
	export VeriSignClass3PublicPrimaryCertificationAuthority-G5 to a file
5. copy VeriSignClass3PublicPrimaryCertificationAuthority-G5 to /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/ 
.
